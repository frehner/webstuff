This project is "sprint 2" of my semester long project.  Once sprint 1 (the administrative side of the PoS system) was completed, we were then required to build a webpage for customers to be able to browse, select, and purchase items for their accounts that they were able to create and log into.

The project was eventually integrated on a VM running IIS with Apache Tomcat, and a MySQL database.  (That VM is no longer accessable; something about the Information Systems department not wanting to host hundreds of websites...)
